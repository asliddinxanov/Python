## Imgae Processing in Python

Images define the world, each image has its own story, it contains a lot of crucial information that can be useful in many ways. This information can be obtained with the help of the technique known as Image Processing.

It is the core part of computer vision which plays a crucial role in many real-world examples like robotics, self-driving cars, and object detection. Image processing allows us to transform and manipulate thousands of images at a time and extract useful insights from them. It has a wide range of applications in almost every field. 

Python is one of the widely used programming languages for this purpose. Its amazing libraries and tools help in achieving the task of image processing very efficiently. 

## What is image processing?
As the name says, image processing means processing the image and this may include many different techniques until we reach our goal.

The final output can be either in the form of an image or a corresponding feature of that image. This can be used for further analysis and decision making.

But what is an image?

An image can be represented as a 2D function F(x,y) where x and y are spatial coordinates. The amplitude of F at a particular value of x,y is known as the intensity of an image at that point. If x,y, and the amplitude value is finite then we call it a digital image. It is an array of pixels arranged in columns and rows. Pixels are the elements of an image that contain information about intensity and color. An image can also be represented in 3D where x,y, and z become spatial coordinates. Pixels are arranged in the form of a matrix. This is known as an `RGB` image.
There are various types of images:

・RGB image: It contains three layers of 2D image, these layers are Red, Green, and Blue channels.

・Grayscale image: These images contain shades of black and white and contain only a single channel.
